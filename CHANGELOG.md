#v.0.0.8
Aw yeah, we snuck in a tiny update 🎉! Meet the `Legend` component. It's great
for pagination usage or any place where you need to show where along the process
a user is (i.e. step 2 of 4). Check out the demo site for usage info. That's 
all we have for now, but the big icon lib component is coming very soon, 
so watch out!


# v0.0.7
Hey, there! 👋 As always, thanks for checking out the first installments of the
Whiplash React UI Library. This change brings an updated UI for the
docs/examples in addition to a new `Breadcrumb` component! 🍞

Additionally, due to the fast response we've had from the installs, we are
now making the repo public so you can
[submit bugs](https://github.com/whiplashmerch/whiplash-ui-library/issues)
if you find any or add feature requests to any of the living Components.

As of right now, we are not allowing any contributions outside of that. 😿

### Future Components
The next versions will introduce a bunch of new Components that will lead up to
the `0.1.0` release ("Be cool Ice Cold, be cool.")!

* ShopCard
* ICONS! 😎
* RadioBtn
* InputStatusIcon
* Legend
* DropdownBtn

Thanks again and we hope you stick around as we grow this resource for the React
community.
