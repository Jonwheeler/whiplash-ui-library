# Bug Reporting
If you find bugs while using the Library, please report them
[here](https://github.com/whiplashmerch/whiplash-ui-library/issues) with a
descriptive title and as much information as you can give in the body. As soon
as we can, we will address them and push up fixes immediately.

# Feature Requests
Currently, we are only allowing feature requests on living Components that are
already established within the Library. As soon as we hit the `1.0.0` release,
we will start accepting *new* features.

To submit a feature request, follow the same guides as bug reporting.
